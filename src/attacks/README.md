# Attack Modules

This directory contains DMA attack implementations and payloads for testing virtualized environments.

## Purpose

Provide a modular library of DMA attack techniques targeting different operating systems and security mechanisms. Each module implements specific attack vectors for testing IOMMU defenses and memory protection systems.

## Planned Attack Modules

### Linux Attacks
- [ ] **linux_attacks.py** - Core Linux attack library
  - Password bypass via pam_unix.so patching
  - Memory credential extraction
  - Kernel-level implant injection
  - Process memory manipulation

### Windows Attacks  
- [ ] **windows_attacks.py** - Windows-specific attack implementations
  - MsvpPasswordValidate function patching
  - LSASS memory dumping
  - Secret extraction using known signatures
  - Privilege escalation techniques

### Generic Attacks
- [ ] **memory_scanner.py** - Generic memory pattern scanning
- [ ] **process_injector.py** - Cross-platform process injection
- [ ] **credential_harvester.py** - Multi-OS credential extraction
- [ ] **persistence_modules.py** - Maintaining access across reboots

### Advanced Research
- [ ] **iommu_bypass.py** - IOMMU evasion techniques
- [ ] **hypervisor_attacks.py** - VM escape attempts
- [ ] **custom_device_attacks.py** - Malicious PCIe device payloads

## Module Structure

Each attack module should implement:
- **Target identification** - Locate vulnerable memory regions
- **Payload delivery** - Execute the attack vector
- **Verification** - Confirm successful execution
- **Cleanup** - Restore original state if needed

## Safety Guidelines

⚠️ **WARNING**: These modules contain actual attack code and should only be used in controlled environments. Never run against systems without explicit authorization.

## Development Standards

- All modules must include comprehensive logging
- Implement fail-safe mechanisms for testing environments
- Document memory addresses and offsets used
- Provide detection signatures for defensive research
