- Presenters: Joe and Grace (collaboration support from the PASIV team)
- Quick summary: Live demonstration of DMA-enabled memory tampering to hijack ERCâ€‘20 token transfers from within a running VM. The session walks through configuring a vulnerable target, observing ASCIIâ€‘encoded Web3 transaction data in memory (e.g., `0xa9059cbbâ€¦`), and performing realâ€‘time recipient address substitution before broadcast, along with discussion of mitigations and research ethics.

### Overview
This demo shows how to:
- Launch an Ubuntu VM with file-backed (DMA-accessible) memory
- Install MetaMask in the VM and add the Base network + USDC token
- Fund the VM wallet with a small amount of USDC on Base
- Initiate a USDC transfer to `vitalik.eth`
- Run `ascii_transfer_monitor.py` from the host to hijack the destination address in real-time

The hijack works by scanning the VM's memory for ASCII-encoded ERC-20 transfer calls (`0xa9059cbbâ€¦`) and replacing the 40-hex-character recipient with an attacker-chosen value.

### 0) Host Prerequisites
- Ubuntu host with virtualization support (KVM)
- QEMU installed: `sudo apt install -y qemu-system-x86 qemu-kvm`  
- Optional viewers: `sudo apt install -y tigervnc-viewer remote-viewer`  
- Python 3.8+ available on host  
- This repo cloned and you are in the project root: `/home/pierce/projects/PASIV`

Note: The included launcher starts QEMU directly with file-backed RAM for DMA.

---

### 1) Start the VM with DMA-accessible memory (Host)
From the PASIV project root:

```bash
./scripts/launch/launch_dma_qemu_direct.sh
```

What this does:
- Creates `./pasiv_vm_memory.raw` (4 GB) in the repo root and launches a VM with RAM backed by this file
- Also creates/refreshes a symlink `./pasiv_vm_memory.img` -> `./pasiv_vm_memory.raw`
- QEMU GTK window appears (or connect via VNC at `localhost:5901`)
- SSH forwarding available on `localhost:2222` (inside VM once configured)

(If needed) Recreate the link the monitor reads by default:

```bash
ln -sf ./pasiv_vm_memory.raw ./pasiv_vm_memory.img
```

Verification (optional):
```bash
hexdump -C ./pasiv_vm_memory.raw | head -10
# Expect non-zero data once the VM is booted
```

---

### 2) Inside the VM: Install Browser and MetaMask
In the VM desktop:
1. Install a Chromium/Chrome or Firefox browser
2. Install the MetaMask extension from the official store
3. Create a new wallet (record the seed phrase securely and offline)

---

### 3) Add the Base Network to MetaMask (Mainnet)
In MetaMask -> Networks -> Add network manually:
- Network Name: `Base`
- RPC URL: `https://mainnet.base.org`
- Chain ID: `8453`
- Currency Symbol: `ETH`
- Block Explorer: `https://basescan.org`

Save.

---

### 4) Add USDC Token on Base
USDC (Base) contract:
```
0x833589fCD6EDB6E08f4c7c32D4f71B54Bda02913
```
In MetaMask -> Assets -> Import Tokens:
- Token contract address: paste the above
- Name/Symbol should auto-fill as USDC

---

### 5) Fund the VM Wallet with Small USDC on Base
Transfer ~$2 USDC (or less) to the VM wallet address on Base.  
Options: send from another wallet you control, a centralized exchange with Base withdrawals, or bridge from another chain.  
Wait for the balance to appear in MetaMask (Base).

---

### 6) Prepare the Demo Transaction to vitalik.eth
In MetaMask (VM):
1. Select USDC asset
2. Click Send
3. In the Recipient field, enter `vitalik.eth` (ENS resolves to `0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045`)
4. Enter Amount: `1` USDC
5. Proceed to the confirmation screen but do not confirm yet

Leave the confirmation dialog open so that the transfer data is resident in memory.

---

### 7) Run the ASCII Transfer Monitor (Host)
From the host, in the PASIV project root:

```bash
# (Optional) activate venv if you use one
# source venv/bin/activate

python3 ascii_transfer_monitor.py
```

Notes:
- No arguments = universal mode (hijacks ANY ERC-20 `transfer()` found)
- The tool scans `./pasiv_vm_memory.img` which links to the VMâ€™s RAM file
- You should see logs like:
  - `Target: ANY ERC-20 transfer (universal attack mode)`
  - `ðŸŽ¯ NEW ERC-20 TRANSFER(S) DETECTED! ...`
  - `ðŸ”¥ DMA ATTACK SUCCESSFUL!`

---

### 8) Execute the Transfer in MetaMask (VM)
Back in the VM:
- Click Confirm in MetaMask for the 1 USDC transfer to `vitalik.eth`
- The host monitor should immediately log detections and successful replacements

By default, the tool replaces the 40-hex recipient with an easily-visible pattern (counter + `66` filler).  
If you want to redirect to a specific attacker address, edit `generate_evil_address()` in `ascii_transfer_monitor.py` to return your ASCII-hex address (40 lowercase hex chars, no `0x`).

---

### 9) Verify on BaseScan
After MetaMask broadcasts the transaction:
1. Copy the Tx hash from MetaMask
2. Open `https://basescan.org/tx/<TX_HASH>` in the VM browser
3. Verify the `To` (token recipient) is NOT Vitalikâ€™s address. It should match the replaced value printed by the tool.

If you changed the evil address to your own, you should receive the USDC.

---

### 10) Troubleshooting
- Memory file shows only zeros:
  - Ensure the VM was started with `launch_dma_qemu_direct.sh` and that `-object memory-backend-file,...,mem-path=<project_path>/pasiv_vm_memory.raw` is present in the QEMU command line
  - Recreate the link: `ln -sf ./pasiv_vm_memory.raw ./pasiv_vm_memory.img`
- No detections:
  - Confirm youâ€™re sending USDC on Base and are on the final confirmation screen
  - Ensure the selector printed in the monitor includes `0xa9059cbb...`
  - Let the monitor run while you press Confirm
- Permission denied on the VM disk:
  - Stop any libvirt VMs using the same image (`sudo virsh list --all`) and ensure only the direct QEMU process has the disk open
- Viewer access:
  - QEMU GTK opens a window on the host desktop.  
  - Or connect via VNC: `vncviewer localhost:1` (port 5901)

---

### 11) Cleanup
- Close the VM window or send `System -> Power Off` inside the VM
- Remove the RAM file and link if desired:
```bash
rm -f ./pasiv_vm_memory.raw ./pasiv_vm_memory.img
```
